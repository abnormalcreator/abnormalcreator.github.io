Here we are! I've wanted my own website for a while now, so I feel accomplished. I am hosting this website on GitHub and it is built with Jekyll. 
I have been following [this guide](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) which provides a super quick introduction to GitHub Pages. 
Stay tuned for more posts from me.

Today, after about a week of reading, I finished [The Richest Man in Babylon](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon/5MeNDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0). The book describes basic principles of money by employing a sequence of parables set in the ancient city. The language is entertaining, an example quote being "set thy purse to fattening," which is the main idea of the book. Pay yourself before spending (save no less than one-tenth of your income) and your purse shall fatten.
